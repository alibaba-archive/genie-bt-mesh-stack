### chip_id() -- get chip revision id

	# make sure the CPU is stopped and in a known state
        reset halt

	# chip id not known, print chip id for diagnostics
	echo [format "Unknown chip id 0x%08x" $chip_id(0)]

}

### chip_fix() -- do chip specific fixup

proc chip_fixup { } {
	$chip_id(0)
}

### program_image() -- program flash using openocd flash commands
#
# 1. Reset and halt processor in a known state
# 2. Erase the requested flash region and write $filename data at $offset
#    in the flash

### load() -- load any generic application axf image to ram and run ###
#
# 1. Reset and halt processor in a known state
# 2. Load axf image into internal ram of target device
# 3. Verify loaded axf image
# 4. Pass control to loaded image using its entry point address
#
# NOTE: Entry point address of axf image can be found using
# command: readelf -h <image>

### sh_load() -- load flashprog.axf (flash tool) image to ram and run ###
#
# 1. Reset and halt processor in a known state
# 2. Enable arm semihosting
# 3. Load axf image into internal ram of target device
# 4. Verify loaded axf image
# 5. Pass control to loaded image using its entry point address
#
# NOTE: Entry point address of axf image can be found using
